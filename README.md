Some of the real attributes were useful, converted them to discrete
feature with appropriate binning. Used log-probabilities to avoid numerical errors.
Reported the following:
1. Summary of the data.
2. Explained how you choose to handle missing entries and why?
3. Ran the 10-fold cross validation 30 times and then report the average cross validation
accuracy and its standard deviation.
